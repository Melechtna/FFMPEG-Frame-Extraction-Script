# FFMPEG Frame Extraction Script

I needed this for a project, it takes an input file, and extracts it to a same named folder without any extra needed arguements. If available, it will also extract audio tracks as lossless wav. This is useful for video upscaling and frame interpolation by making the extraction process completely painless.
